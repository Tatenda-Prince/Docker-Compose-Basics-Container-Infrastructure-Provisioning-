# Intro 
Today, we are going to take it a step further to use a Docker Compose file to build/provision an infrastructure of running container according to the configurations written in the file.


# Docker Compose Information

# Docker Compose

Docker-compose reads configuration data from a Docker Compose YAML file usually named “docker-compose.yml” to provision container application services.

# Docker compose up

The “docker compose up” command starts and restarts all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

# Docker compose down

The “docker compose down” stops and removes all containers and networks created by the docker-compose.yml file.

# Docker inspect <container_name>

The “docker inspect <container_name>” command lists extensive and complete information of the container provided.

# Prerequisites

Basic knowledge and understanding of containerization and Docker

Basic Linux command line knowledge

Basic knowledge and use of an Interactive Development Environment (IDE).
